# modeScoreUIPrototype
This is a protype UI/UX of the mode score web3 application for the mode BCAMP cohort. I have designed this rather quickly, heavily using AI to build scaffholding for CSS and html. This is NOT intended to be the final  UI/UX of the site, but rather an option and idea for the app.
